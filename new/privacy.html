    <section id="legal-bases">
      <h2>3. Legal Bases For Processing Personal Information</h2>
      <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary, and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, such as your consent, compliance with laws, fulfillment of contractual obligations, protection of rights, or legitimate business interests.</p>

      <h3>If you are located in the EU or UK:</h3>
      <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on to process your personal information. We may rely on the following legal bases:</p>

      <ul class="bold-list">
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about <a href="#withdraw-consent">withdrawing your consent</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong> We may process your personal information when it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> We may process your information when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your information to:
          <ul>
            <li>Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services.</li>
            <li>Develop and display personalized and relevant advertising content.</li>

        <li><strong>Vital Interests:</strong> We may process your information when necessary to protect your vital interests or those of a third party, such as in situations involving threats to personal safety.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>If you are located in Canada:</h3>
      <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) for a specific purpose or where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can <a href="#withdraw-consent">withdraw your consent</a> at any time.</p>
      <p>In some exceptional cases, we may process your information without your consent if legally permitted, such as:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If collection is clearly in an individual&#8217;s interest and consent cannot be obtained promptly.</li>
        <li>For investigations and fraud detection or prevention.</li>
        <li>For business transactions, provided certain conditions are met.</li>
        <li>If contained in a witness statement for insurance claim assessment or settlement.</li>
        <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin.</li>
        <li>If there are reasonable grounds to believe an individual may be a victim of financial abuse.</li>
        <li>If obtaining consent would compromise the availability or accuracy of the information, and collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating breaches of agreements or laws.</li>
        <li>If disclosure is required by subpoena, warrant, court order, or court rules regarding records production.</li>
        <li>If the information was produced in the course of employment, business, or profession and aligns with its original purposes.</li>
        <li>For journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes.</li>

      <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it.

      <h2>11. Information Security</h2>

      <h2>14. &#8220;Do-Not-Track&#8221; Features</h2>
      <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&#8220;DNT&#8221;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
